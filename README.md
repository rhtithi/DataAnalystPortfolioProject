# Tithi Raha Portfolio Project
# About
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tithi! I have developed a strong foundation in Data science and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my training and certification courses, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Here is my CV in PDF.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

Goal: To Draw Insights to Help Marketing Team 

Description: 
In this project, my role involves analyzing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app 
to provide valuable insights that can help the business grow. 
User analysis involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software 
application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams 
within the business.  

For example, the marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, the product 
team might use them to decide on new features to build, and the development team might use them 
to improve the overall user experience. 

In this project, Iâ€™ll be using SQL and MySQL Workbench as my tool to analyze Instagram user data and 
answer questions posed by the management team. The insights will help the product manager and 
the rest of the team make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app. 
My findings could potentially influence the future development of one of the world's most popular 
social media platforms. 

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, SQL

Technology: MySQL Workbench
